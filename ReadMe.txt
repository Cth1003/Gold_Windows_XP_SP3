[---------- INFORMATION ----------]

(#) General:

1. Based on the original English (International) Windows XP Professional SP3 x86 (Volume License) ISO file from Microsoft.
2. Fully Updatable and passes all Validation Checks and no Gold Windows XP 2016 Activation or Crack or CD-Key is needed.
3. The installation process is Unattended with the Recovery Console and Repair option, A valid WGA CD-Key and all the other user required inputs are filled in automatically during the Gold Windows XP 2016 installation.
4. Runs a little faster than a regular Gold Windows XP 2016 because all the Gold Windows XP 2016 Update are slipstreamed and because some outdated and useless components have been removed (Nothing was removed that could cause system or software problems).
5. After the Gold Windows XP 2016 installation a menu will appear to choose which {Optional} extras to integrate. If nothing was selected after 70 Seconds then the default selected {Optional} extras are integrated.
6. All Modified files are Digitally Signed with a separte Certificate.



(#) Important:

1. This Gold Windows XP 2016 is not for Upgrading you must make a clean installation on a formatted Hard disk drive or Partition.
2. Before doing a real installation it is recommended to do a test installation with a Virtual Machine program, such as VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org).



(#) Administrative:

* To modify this Gold Windows XP 2016 open the ISO file "Gold XP 2016 SP3 + Drivers By Computer Worm.iso" with a Zip-Archive Program (http://www.7-zip.org) and extract everything except the "[BOOT]" folder (if present) into an empty folder and use nLite (http://www.nlite.com) to make a Bootable ISO file after the modifications.
1. To get a list of all the installed Gold Windows XP 2016 Updates run the DOS Command "qfecheck" in a Command Prompt Window.
2. With a little bit of scripting knowledge it is possible to integrate additional Programs and Custom Settings by editing the files with a Text Editor in the ISO/Disc directory "..\OEM\RunOnce" and also the files "WINNT.SIF", "NLITE.IN_", "HIVEWBE.INF" and "WXPBERO.CM_" in the ISO/Disc directory "..\I386" (DOS uncompress Command Line is [expand -r "FOLDER\FILE.IN_"] and DOS compress Command Line is [makecab "FOLDER\FILE.INF"]).
3. A full automated installation can be done by removing the ";FUI#" with a Text Editor from the file "WINNT.SIF" in the ISO/Disc directory "..\I386". If setting the "Repartition" option from "No" to "Yes" then the Gold Windows XP 2016 Setup will not only skip the EULA agreement but will then also automatically format the main Hard Disk Drive and install itself on a new created partition. Note when doing this changes then the Recovery Console and Repair option can then no longer be accessed anymore directly from disc.
